ModularCanvas is a hobby project that I've been working on. It aims to replicate all of the major features of a canvas manipulation library such as [Processing.js](https://github.com/processing-js/processing-js) or, more notably in my specific case, [ski.js](https://github.com/thelegendski/ski.js). In addition, I'm adding some features that I thought would be nice to have.
 - A custom import ecosystem style. This way, it doesn't have to come with everything out of the box (though it'll still be the default for those who don't know/care about this feature).
 - Support to run multiple canvas objects at once (and keep track of relative statistics like mouse position and keys pressed while the canvas is focused).
 - A modular design, which enables cleaner, shorter files.
